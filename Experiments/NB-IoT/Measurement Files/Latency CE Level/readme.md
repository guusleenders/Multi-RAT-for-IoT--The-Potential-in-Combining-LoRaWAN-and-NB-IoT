# Measurements of latency regarding NB-IoT
Included in this directory are the samples involved in measuring the latency in the connection of NB-IoT (regarding CE Levels). Files are named after:

```
Latency --CE Level--
```

CSV files are structured as below: 
```
sent timestamp, arrived timestamp
```

All samples were measured, connector to NB-IoT TAC 0x2BF5A08.
