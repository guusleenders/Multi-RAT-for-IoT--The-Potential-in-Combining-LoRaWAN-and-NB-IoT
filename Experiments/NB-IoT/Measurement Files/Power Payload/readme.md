# Measurements of the payload size influence on the energy consumption of NB-IoT
Included in this directory are the samples involved in measuring the payload size influence on the energy consumption of NB-IoT. 
The properties in these measurements can be found in the file name: 

```
Payload --CE Level-- --Payload Size--
```

Power consumption is measured as the voltage drop over a resistor. CSV files are structured as below: 
```
CH1, CH2, CH3 (state indicator)
```

All samples were measured, connector to NB-IoT TAC 0x2BF5A08.
